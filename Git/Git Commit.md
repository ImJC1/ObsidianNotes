`git commit` records changes made to the staged files by the user to the repository
#### Useful options:
`-a` or `--all`: Tell the command to automatically stage all modified and deleted files, doesn't add any newly created ones, that has to be done manually.

`-m <blah blah mlep>` or `--message <mlep :p blah>`: Use the given message as the commit message, if multiple are given they are to be used as separate paragraphs.
