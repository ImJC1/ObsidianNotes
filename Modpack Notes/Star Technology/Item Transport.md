Over *short-to-mid* range the method I use for item transport is [[Pipez]], as they're reasonably cheap and easy to setup as well as quicker and more advanced than [[Gregtech]] pipes.
Over *long* range the method I use for item transport is Laserio, unfortunately they're not as cheap as Pipez but they work really well and are really configurable and fast.
