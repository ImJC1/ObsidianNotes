# THE MEATPACK
## Wheat Death of the Technology is a technology modpack centered around WDOTU made by WheatenEye.
You begin your life in a world overriden by flesh-made creatures with an empty book and another one that is actually quite useless in hand. You may get **Hepatitis B**, and you may get **Depressed** under the influence of this unholy world. **But you will prevail.**

It features mods such as:
- Wheat Death of the Universe, and a few addons.
- Thermal Series mods
- Ballistix (the use of the electrodynamics mod has been reduced to close to nothing)
- Compact Machines
- Refined Storage
- Functional Storage
- Project E (transposing is blacklisted until later updates)
- QuarryPlus
- Mutant Monsters
- Apotheosis
- Entangled
- Modular Routers
- Curvy Pipes
- Utilitix
- Mob Grinding Utils
- Chipped
- QoL mods, Optimization mods (Embeddium), and a custom made mod for modpack exclusive content.
