Pretty much Magic Storage mod but for minecraft, it adds blocks such as:
- Storage / Crafting Terminal - an interface that adds sorting, searching and crafting capabilities to any storage block.
- Inventory Connectors - which connect all adjacent storage blocks and merge them into one, it doesn't have a GUI by itself and can only be accesed by the use of a terminal.
- Inventory Cables / Trims - connect storage blocks that are **not** adjacent to an inventory connector
