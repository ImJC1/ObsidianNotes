### 1. **The git method**:
This is the method I'll be using to sync my notes because it takes close to no effort and doesn't cost a penny.

To begin, you need to create a **git repository**, I'm using **Github** for this because it's free and I'm already used to it.

At first, the repository will be empty, so you need to import your **desired Obsidian Vault** into the repository. If you understand the way **Obsidian** works you know that all you need to load a Vault is a directory with **markdown files** stored in the Vault. Now what you just did was host said files in a repository you can access from **all around the world** on all of your devices.

#### Notice (see [[Git Basics]]):
The changes don't save automatically, and with every change that you want to accept, you need to **commit them to the repository**.

To add your notes to another device you need to **clone the repository**.

To update your notes with changes commited on another device you need to **pull the changes**.
