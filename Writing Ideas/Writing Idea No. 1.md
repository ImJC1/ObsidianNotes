Two characters with immense ability in a skill, something like fighting for this example.
Character A was born with immense talent and doesn't need to practice, but they also find practice daunting and useless.
Character A kept challenging Character B to many fights, with Character B almost always ending defeated.
Character B was practically useless at fighting for much of their life, but in the heart of competition they trained and trained until they got interrupted by a career-ending injury, like losing their arm or leg.
Character B constantly thought about not being good enough even when approaching levels comparable to Character A.
Character A helped Character B get over the terrible event and that gave Character B an idea to overcome it and not give up.
Character B got a bionic or something else that balances the playing field, they were terrible at using it all at first, but they got the hang of it and with time and effort gained ability equal to that of Character A
Character B wins the fight, but loses their goal for life and eventually makes fighting harder and harder by trying on more and more difficult challenges, like one could fight without the use of bionics at all.
Character B is over Character A in ability.
Character A and B lose their passion and as time goes on, skill.
Character A is now older and more grumpy.
Character B now boasts over their past achievements, even after losing their skill.
Character A and B reunite and decide to fight for once more, the fight seems to be equal with neither side having an advantage.
They both call it off.
They both are satisfied with their lives, getting to forget their past.
They forget.
